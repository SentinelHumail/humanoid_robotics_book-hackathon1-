# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

> Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body

## Course Overview

This course introduces **Physical AI** — AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac.

## About This Book

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** interactive learning experience. This book combines cutting-edge robotics theory with hands-on practice, guiding you through the journey from basic concepts to advanced humanoid robot deployment.

### What Makes This Book Different

- **Interactive Elements**: Hover over jargon terms for instant explanations
- **Progressive Learning**: Each module builds systematically on previous knowledge
- **Real-World Focus**: Emphasis on practical applications and industry-relevant skills
- **Cyberpunk Interface**: Designed for an immersive, futuristic learning experience

### Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for:
- **Students** interested in robotics and AI
- **Engineers** looking to transition into physical AI
- **Researchers** exploring embodied intelligence
- **Hobbyists** passionate about humanoid robotics
- **Educators** teaching advanced robotics concepts

### Learning Philosophy

We believe in learning by doing. This book emphasizes:
1. **Theory + Practice**: Every concept is paired with hands-on implementation
2. **Iterative Development**: Build complexity gradually
3. **Real-World Problems**: Solve actual robotics challenges
4. **Community Learning**: Share insights and collaborate with peers

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:

- **Understand** Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- **Master** ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- **Simulate** robots with Gazebo and Unity
- **Develop** with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- **Design** humanoid robots for natural interactions
- **Integrate** GPT models for conversational robotics

## Course Structure

This course is organized into 4 modules spanning 13 weeks:

| Module | Topic | Weeks | Focus |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Module 1** | The Robotic Nervous System | Weeks 1-2 | ROS 2 Fundamentals |
| **Module 2** | The Digital Twin | Weeks 3-5 | Gazebo Simulation |
| **Module 3** | The AI-Robot Brain | Weeks 6-7 | NVIDIA Isaac |
| **Module 4** | Vision-Language-Action | Weeks 8-13 | VLA & Capstone |

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments.

This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.

## Getting Started

1. **Review Hardware Requirements** - Ensure your workstation meets the specifications
2. **Set Up Your Environment** - Install required software (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac)
3. **Begin with Module 1** - Start with ROS 2 fundamentals
4. **Progress Sequentially** - Each module builds on previous knowledge

## Hardware Prerequisites

This course requires specific hardware for simulation and development:

- **Workstation**: NVIDIA RTX GPU (12GB+ VRAM), 64GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04
- **Optional Edge Kit**: Jetson Orin Nano for deployment
- **Optional Robot**: Unitree Go2 or similar for physical testing

See [Hardware Requirements](/docs/hardware/requirements) for detailed specifications.

## Course Assessments
