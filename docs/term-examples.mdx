import Term from '@site/src/components/Term';

# Using the Term Component

The `<Term>` component adds hover tooltips for jargon and complex terms. It's perfect for explaining concepts to readers.

## Basic Usage

```jsx
import Term from '@site/src/components/Term';

// Simple term with definition
<Term word="PWM" definition="Pulse Width Modulation - a technique for controlling analog devices with digital signals" />

// Custom display text
<Term word="IMU" definition="Inertial Measurement Unit - measures orientation and acceleration">
  IMU sensor
</Term>
```

## Examples

Here are some examples in action:

- <Term word="PID" definition="Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller - a feedback control loop mechanism" />
- <Term word="ROS" definition="Robot Operating System - a framework for writing robot software">ROS</Term>
- <Term word="SLAM" definition="Simultaneous Localization and Mapping - algorithmic problem of constructing a map while tracking the location" />

## Styling

Terms are highlighted with cyan text and a dotted underline. Hover to see the definition in a cyberpunk-styled tooltip.

## Best Practices

1. Use for technical jargon that might confuse readers
2. Keep definitions concise (1-2 sentences)
3. Use consistently throughout your documentation
4. Consider the reading context - don't overuse
